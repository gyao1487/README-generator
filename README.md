# README Generator

## Description
A simple application that runs on the command-line with Node.js to dynamically generate a professional README.md based on user's input using Inquirer. It allows for a quick and easy generation of a project README, as the user only needs to input the important information, leaving the busy work of formatting to the app. 

## Installation
1. `git clone` the repo to your local machine so that you have the project files

* `inquirer`


## Usage
![Video Demo](./assets/demo-thumbnail.gif)

3. After the prompts are all answered, a success message will appear on the command line, and a new file named `new-README.md` will be generated in the root folder of the repo 
4. Click on the `new-README.md` file to view your brand new automatically generated README
* The README will also automatically generate a license badge at the top of your README based on the answer you entered
